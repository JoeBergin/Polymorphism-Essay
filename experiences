Many instructors have judged this topic too difficult to teach, though I have found effective ways to do it, using some ideas from agile software development. ",

I tend to give \"correct\" but not necessarily \"clear\" descriptions. I work against this tendency, but it is still there. I was raised as a mathematician, after all. ",

When I reach a topic with many deep implications, the wiki lets me easily (trivially) factor them out to separate pages. ",

I also find myself, writing here, constantly thinking about the presentation, though not in terms of complex markup. I think about what the user would like to see together on a page for comparison.
