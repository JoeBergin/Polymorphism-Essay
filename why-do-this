This, sadly, is lacking in many programmers, even those who consider themselves \"experts\" in OO. ",

[[Joe Bergin]] has learned that instructors have a difficult time teaching polymorphism and too many instructors have abandoned the attempt. In the past he, along with Eugene Wallingford have issued the \"Polymorphism Challenge\" which is to attempt to write some standard bit of code without any if or switch statements (or at least a minimal number). The purpose is really just for purposes of skill building so that the one taking up the challenge learns to better use his or her tools.",

The essay explains a bit of the How, the Why, and the [[Consequences]]. ",
