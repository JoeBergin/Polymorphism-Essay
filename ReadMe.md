<p>This project is an attempt to use the Smallest Federated Wiki to explore writing an extended essay. In this case, the essay is Joe Bergin's thoughts on how to develop a Polymorphic Program. </p>

<p>Joe has learned that instructors have a difficult time teaching this and too many have abandoned the attempt. In the past he, along with Eugene Wallingford have issued the "Polymorphism Challenge" which is to attempt to write some standard bit of code without any if or switch statements (or at least a minimal number). The purpose is really just for purposes of skill building so that the one taking up the challenge learns to better use his or her tools. </p>

<p>This was based on Joe's "Polymorphism Etude" paper (unpublished), which makes the same point. </p>

<p>Later on, the Anti-If Campaign came along and was joined by some pretty impressive actors: Kent Beck among them. </p>

<p>Joe maintains that Polymorphic Programming if done well can result in beautiful programs. The essay explains a bit of the How, the Why, and the Consequences. </p>
